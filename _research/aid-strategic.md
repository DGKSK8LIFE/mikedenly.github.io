Applications of principal-agent theory to the study of international organizations overwhelmingly suggest that agents only have as much autonomy as principals delegate to them. By contrast, this article argues that bureaucratic agents' rules, derived from their normative and substantive interests, mostly structure decision-making beyond principals' control. In particular, principals have difficulty using informal influence to constrain rules-based agent autonomy when matters involve long time horizons, which add to principals' already high monitoring costs. This article applies the argument in the context of Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) lending, a matter of high strategic importance to powerful donor country principals. Consistent with the argument, the article shows that the staff-led ratings of countries' institutional environments at four MDBs are more important determinants of lending outcomes than traditional measures of principal strategic interests. Moreover, the ratings are also consistently and significantly related to other non-lending outcomes in replicating many prior studies. Overall, the results strongly suggest that international organization agents can build in formal rules that serve their long-term interests and are strong enough to withstand the informal influence of powerful country principals.
