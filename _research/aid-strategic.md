In this paper, I argue that dynamics between donors (principals) and institutions (agents) render multilateral aid less prone to capture by principalsâ€™ strategic interests than most literature suggests. Agents whose project cycles have long time horizons make principal monitoring very challenging, which leads to greater agent autonomy. Similarly, agents' preferences for their survival and principals' actions to secure agent survival in the post-Cold War period have made strategic interests even less salient. To support my argument, I leverage new data on how staff at the World Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank rank the institutional environments of recipient countries. These data provide a crucial test for my argument because these international organizations  use these institutional ratings data to determine the creditworthiness of recipient countries. Using numerous model specifications relating to the number of loans allocated and money received, I find broad support for my argument. Especially but not exclusively since the end of the Cold War, countries with positions of power in the international system are less able to pick the winners and losers of development through multilateral aid than most literature suggests. The results of this study contribute to emerging literatures showing that ``aid is not oil'', and that bureaucratic factors are crucial for understanding international organizations and foreign aid.
