Applications of principal-agent theory to the study of international organizations overwhelmingly suggest that agents only have as much autonomy as principals delegate to them. By contrast, this article argues that bureaucratic agents often develop rules, derived from their normative and substantive objectives, that structure decision-making beyond principals' grasps. In particular, principals have difficulty constraining agent autonomy on longer-term processes that involve high principal monitoring costs. This article applies the argument in the context of Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) lending, a matter of high strategic importance to powerful donor country principals. Consistent with the argument, the article shows that staff-led Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIAs) at four MDBs are more important determinants of lending outcomes than traditional measures of principal strategic interests. Moreover, the CPIAs are also consistently and significantly related to other non-lending outcomes in replicating many prior studies. Overall, the results strongly suggest that international organization agents can build in rules that drive decision-making toward the bureaucratsâ€™ long-term interests.
