External validity refers to how the inferences drawn from a given study apply outside of the immediate sample to a broader population or other target populations. Unfortunately, the extent to which social science scholarship makes accurate external validity inferences is minimal. In this article, we clarify the conceptual dimensions of external validity, formally demonstrate why external validity matters, and then advance three evaluative criteria: *Model Utility*, *Scope Plausibility*, and *Specification Credibility*. In addition to articulating the components of these criteria, we conclude with proposed evaluation and reporting standards for external validity. It is our hope that these evaluation and reporting standards help re-balance scientific inquiry, such that the current obsession with causal inference is complemented with an equal interest in generalized knowledge.
