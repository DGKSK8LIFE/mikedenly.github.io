(with Akshat Gautam)

We show that once low or decreasing poverty reduces voter need for clientelism, it ultimately reduces corruption through political institutions. Our theoretical and empirical framework focuses on party alignment--i.e., when politicians' share the same party at higher and lower levels of government. Aligned politicians generally enjoy resource advantages due to their affiliation with the executive. However, we show that close elections discipline aligned politicians to engage in less corruption once economic circumstances are better. For identification, we rely on close-election regression discontinuity designs that analyze the number of audit violations committed and the amount of money misappropriated in Guatemalan municipalities. The results of our study help document how the modernization (poverty) and institutional approaches to reducing corruption interact. [[Draft Paper](https://mikedenly.com/files/dg-corruption.pdf)]
