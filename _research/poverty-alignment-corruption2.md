(with Akshat Gautam)

We examine how corruption levels depend on the political-institutional configuration of party alignment: that is, when politicians share the same party at higher and lower levels of government. Aligned politicians generally enjoy large resource advantages due to their affiliation with the executive. However, we show that party alignment can also reduce corruption if politicians are subject to significant electoral competition and voters' poverty levels are low or decreasing. Our empirical analysis draws on a large new dataset detailing the number of audit violations committed and the amount of money misappropriated in Guatemalan municipalities. For causal identification, we rely on a series of close-election regression discontinuity designs. The results of our study help document how the reduction of corruption through modernization forces such as decreasing poverty takes place through political institutions.
