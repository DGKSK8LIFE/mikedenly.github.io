Have you ever wondered how to make a map in ArcGIS? In this tutorial, we cover all of the basics: coordinate systems, how to work with shapefiles, spatial joins, and much more. By the end of the workshop, you will be able to plot point data and color in your map based on the values of spatial polygons using ArcGIS' symbology function.
