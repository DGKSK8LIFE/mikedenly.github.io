Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin and [Governance Team](http://www.ipdutexas.org/governance.html) Leader at Innovations for Peace and Development. I study the political economy of development, with a particular focus on corruption, natural resources, and public goods provision. Some of my ongoing projects relate to Honduras, Guatemala, India, and Pakistan.

I teach a two-semester undergraduate Research Practicum course at UT-Austin. The course focuses on research design as well as basic statistics and programming, including in R, Stata, ArcGIS, LaTeX, Mendeley, and Excel.

Prior to joining UT-Austin, I worked for the US State Department, the European Commission, and the World Bank. Since starting my PhD, I have consulted extensively for the World Bank and USAID on governance and anti-corruption issues.
